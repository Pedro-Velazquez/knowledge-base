# Microservices

## Advantages
* Enable continuous delivery.
* Allow for an efficient developer workflow because theyâ€™re highly maintainable.
* Are robust by design.
* Can scale up or down independently of each other.

## Key characteristics
* A microservice is responsible for a single capability.
* A microservice is individually deployable.
* A microservice consists of one or more processes.
* A microservice owns its own data store.
* A small team can maintain a few handfuls of microservices.
* A microservice is replaceable.

## Microservices architecture style
Microservices as an architectural
style is a lightweight form of service-oriented architecture (SOA) where the
services are each tightly focused on doing one thing and doing it well. A system with a
microservices architecture is a distributed system with a (probably large) number of
collaborating microservices.
The microservices architectural style has been quickly gaining in popularity for
building and maintaining complex server-side software systems. And understandably
so: microservices offer a number of potential benefits over both more traditional
service-oriented approaches and monolithic architectures. Microservices, when done
well, are malleable, scalable, and robust.
