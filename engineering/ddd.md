# Domain-Driven Design

## Business domain/subdomain

A business domain defines a company’s main area of activity. Generally speaking, it’s the service the company provides to its clients. A company can operate in multiple business domains. It’s important to note that companies may change their business domains often.

To achieve its business domain’s goals and targets, a company has to operate in multiple subdomains. A subdomain is a fine-grained area of business activity. All of a company’s subdomains form its business domain: the service it provides to its customers. Implementing a single subdomain is not enough for a company to succeed; it’s just
one building block in the overarching system. The subdomains have to interact with each other to achieve the company’s goals in its business domain.

### Types of subdomain

* Core: A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors. This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes.
* Generic: Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way. Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement. However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company. There is no need for innovation or optimization here: battletested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.
* Supporting: As the name suggests, supporting subdomains support the company’s business. However, contrary to core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not provide any competitive advantage. Supporting subdomains are simple. Their business logic resembles mostly data entry screens and ETL (extract, transform, load) operations; that is,
the so-called CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) interfaces. These activity areas do not provide any competitive advantage for the company, and therefore do not require high entry barriers.

### Domain expert

Domain experts are subject matter experts who know all the intricacies
of the business that we are going to model and implement in code. In other words, domain experts are knowledge authorities in the software’s business domain. The domain experts are neither the analysts gathering the requirements nor the engineers designing the system. Domain experts represent the business. They are the people who identified the business problem in the first place and from whom all business knowledge originates. Systems analysts and engineers are transforming their mental
models of the business domain into software requirements and source code.
